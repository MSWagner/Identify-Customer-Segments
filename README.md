# Identify Customer Segments

In this project, we will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. 

These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
